# rpg-character-generator
A very simple Java program for randomly generating RPG characters. Users can input a name and select gender, race, and class. Stats are then randomly generated, with some adds or subtracts for specific gender, race, and classes implemented. I made this project as a way of practicing some of the fundamentals of Java, including classes/objects, getters/setters, loops/conditionals, and so forth.
